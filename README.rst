Mission
!!!!!!!

The GA4GH Variation Representation model and accompanying
specification aim to provide a comprehensive coverage for all types of
biological sequence variation.

Specific goals for the project

* Develop common language- and protocol-neutral information models and
  nomenclature for biological sequence variation.
* From the information models, develop data schemas.  The current
  schema is defined in JSON Schema, but other formats are expected.
* Provide algorithmic guidance and conventions to minimize
  representational ambiguity.
* Define a globally unique computed identifier for all variation
  types.
* Develop a `reference implementation
  <https://github.com/ga4gh/vr-python>`__.



History

The genesis of the GA4GH VR project was the Variation Modelling
Collaboration (VMC), which was formed as an independent collaboration
of members of ClinGen, ClinVar, FHIR, and GA4GH.  The VMC
specification received many comments and encouragements, but
ultimately was difficult to use.  In 2017, the VMC group was absorbed
into the GA4GH and underwent a major membership change. In 2019, the
effort is undergoing a major overhaul to adapt ideas from VMC to a new
and more usable model.

Support
!!!!!!!

VMC received significant support from the Broad Institute, GA4GH, and
Invitae.  Current (2019) developments in the model are supported by
GA4GH and GA4GH driver projects.
