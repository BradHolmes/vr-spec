None.

**Computational definition**

The *State* is one of two primary components
specifying a VR :ref:`Allele` (in addition to :ref:`Location`), and is
the designated component for representing change (or non-change) of the
features indicated by the Allele Location. As an abstract class, State
may encompass concrete sequence changes (see :ref:`SequenceState
<sequence-state>`), complex translocations, copy number changes, expression
variation, rule-based variation, and more (see :ref:`planned-states`).
