Here are some tips for writing RST in this repo:

* RST headings are made by adding a line with symbols.  The symbols
  don't matter.  In this repo, the convention is the order of
  shift-number punctuation on a US keyboard -- !, @, #, $ -- which
  correspondes to heading level 1, 2, 3, 4.

* When making a large group of docs, create a directory, put an
  index.rst within it, and refer to `dir/index` in the parent
  index.rst file.  See index.rst and classes/index.rst for an example.
