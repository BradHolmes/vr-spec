Here are some tips for writing RST in this repo:

* RST headings are made by adding an underline and optional overline with symbols.
  Allowable symbols are defined here: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html#section-structure
  In this repo, the convention is the order of shift-number punctuation on a US keyboard -- !, @, #, $ -- which
  corresponds to heading level 1, 2, 3, 4.

* When making a large group of docs, create a directory, put an
  index.rst within it, and refer to `dir/index` in the parent
  index.rst file.  See index.rst and classes/index.rst for an example.
